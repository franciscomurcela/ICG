# Interactive Forest Project

## Overview
The Interactive Forest project is a 3D simulation of a dynamic ecosystem created using Three.js. The application allows users to explore a virtual forest environment, interact with various elements, and experience different weather conditions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Terrain and Vegetation**: The forest is populated with a variety of trees and plants, each with unique textures and sizes.
- **Realistic Lighting**: The scene includes dynamic lighting to simulate the sun's movement throughout the day.
- **Variable Weather Conditions**: Users can experience different climates, including rain and snow, enhancing the immersive experience.
- **First-Person Exploration**: Users can navigate through the forest using keyboard and mouse controls, providing a free exploration experience.
- **Wildlife Interaction**: The environment includes various animals, adding realism and interactivity to the ecosystem.
